Hello there!

My name is Adam Thompson. I am a software/reverse engineer and all around geek currently located in the beautiful state of Colorado. My primary interests are in security and low-level systems development. This website serves as a place for me to occasionally write about my misadventures with technology or any other geeky topics that I may find interesting at the moment. 

If you know me from elsewhere on the internet you may be interested in checking out [my photography](https://www.adamthompsonphoto.com) or [my other blog](https://blog.adamthompsonphoto.com) where I primarily write about my outdoor adventures.
