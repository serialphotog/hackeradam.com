**Hello there!**

My name is Adam Thompson. I am a software/reverse engineer and all around geek currently located in the beautiful state of Colorado. My primary interests are in security and low-level systems development. This website serves as a place for me to occasionally write about my misadventures with technology or any other geeky topics that I may find interesting at the moment. Let's be honest, this blog largely serves as an excuse for me to document and share whatever I'm currently working on ;)

If you know me from elsewhere on the internet you may be interested in checking out [my photography](https://www.adamthompsonphoto.com) or [my other blog](https://blog.adamthompsonphoto.com) where I primarily write about my outdoor adventures.

If you've got other questions, they might be answered on the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page](/faq). If you're looking for something specific, then perhaps I can interest you in the [search page](/search).
