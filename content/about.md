Hello and welcome to my geeky little corner of the internet!

My name is Adam Thompson. I am a software engineer and all around geek currently located in Colorado. My primary interests are in security and low-level systems development. This website is my place to blog about whatever random adventures I'm currently having with computers, security, or just all around geekery.
