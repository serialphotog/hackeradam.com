Here you can find some of the various projects I have worked on over time. This list is by no means exhaustive. 

## Software

Here you can find a small list of some of my personal software projects. This list is probably woefully incomplete. At any given time I have several projects going on and I only occasionally get around to updating this page.

### The Bare Bones Programming Language

[The Bare Bones Programming Language](https://github.com/serialphotog/Bare-Bones-Language) is a simplified programming language that I designed and implemented for my final project for a *Concepts of Programming Languages* class I took during my senior year of my Computer Science degree. It implements a simple lexer, a recursive decent parser, and a code generator that outputs valid C-language code. 

The project is written in C++.

### MTiler

[mTiler](https://github.com/serialphotog/mTiler) is a utility for Microsoft Windows that merges incomplete map tiles into complete tiles. It is written in C# and uses Windows Forms for the GUI.

### Intel 8080 Disassembler

![Output from my Intel 8080 disassembler](/projects/Intel8080DisassemblerOutput.png)

A very simple disassembler for the Intel 8080 microprocessor, written in C. I wrote a blog post detailing the basics of how this project works [here](https://hackeradam.com/lets-write-a-simple-disassembler-for-the-intel-8080-microprocessor/).

You can view this project on [Github](https://github.com/serialphotog/8080disassembler).

### GPX2CSV

This is a simple command line utility that converts waypoints in a GPX file into a CSV file of waypoints. This was developed to allow me to view some of my personal landforms databases in a spreadsheet. Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/serialphotog/gpx2csv).

### MBExport

[MBExport](https://github.com/serialphotog/mbexport) is a small, simple command-line utility that dumps map tiles from an MBTiles database.

### NOAA Animator

This is a simple PHP application that downloads weather radar images from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and converts them into animated GIFs. It is intended to run on some interval as a CRON job. You can view the project on [Github](https://github.com/serialphotog/NOAA-Animator).
