title: "About Me"
---

Hello, and welcome to my little, geeky corner of the web! My name is Adam Thompson, though online I’m probably better known as [The Serial Photog](https://serialphotog.com). My photography is just one aspect of my life, however. I’m also a technical guy that loves nothing more than hacking on all sorts of projects. With this blog, I intend to share not only project logs, but also high-quality articles aimed at teaching you the concepts of everything from computer science to software development (and plenty more in-between).

If you'd like to get in contact with me you can email me at: adam [at] thisdomain.com.
